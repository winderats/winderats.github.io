<p>The first thing you will notice is that our program is very short and a <b>shorter program means less tuition</b>. We focus on hands-on skills and essential knowledge so that you spend your time learning the things you will use every day. We believe <b>hands-on skills and abilities are more important than book knowledge</b>.</p><p>Because <b>we provide hands-on experience in classes</b>, we do not require our students to complete externships. At Winder ATS, our dentists personally work with all the students individually during class hours. Any students who would like additional experience are <b>invited to spend time observing and participating in real patient care</b> during business hours in our office and other offices in our area, including several speciality offices.</p><p>Our classes are taught at <b>Total Transformation Dental and Spa</b> (located at 152 N. Broad Street in Winder, GA), dental office of Dr. Doug Baxter and Dr. Julie Marshall. With this practice established in 1964, we have many years of experience in dentistry to offer to our students.</p><p>Our fees are all inclusive! Our students pay an <b>application fee to apply and reserve placement</b> for classes, then tuition will cover all books, work books, syllabus, training materials and supplies. The only additional cost our students incur is the purchase of a set of scrubs to wear to class.</p>
